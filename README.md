A simple maths bot and a (kind of) weather reporter

## Quadratic Equation:

`!roots` , the command used to execute the quadratic function and echoes the roots or __quadratic roots__ in specific. It in-takes 3 values and stores them in variables, named __a__, __b__, and __c__. The conditional ladder, used in this program, is the defining factor for the roots of the equation. It checks for 4 conditions;

-when __a__ and __b__ i.e., co-efficient of x<sup>2</sup> and co-efficient of x are both Zero,

-when __a__ and __c__ i.e., co-efficient of x<sup>2</sup> and constant are both Zero, and

-when __a__, the co-efficient of x<sup>2</sup> is Zero

-when all of the above conditions are FALSE.

## Weather:
`!weather`, the command used to forecast the temparature of the user-defined city alongside the command. It also shows the current weather condition using an __emoji__ to do so. It relies on [this website](https://www.wttr.in) to extract and process as well as display the data, as per the user's need.
